<h2 id="about" style="text-align:center">About IEEE HMData 2020</h2>
<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>
HMData workshop will investigate the opportunities and challenges in human machine collaboration in work with bigdata, which are described by two terms: <b>Human-in-the-Loop Methods</b> and <b>Future of Work</b>.
Human-in-the-Loop is a term focusing on the employer's viewpoint while Future of Work focuses more on worker's viewpoint, in both of which the division of labor among humans and machines is a key issue.
This area is likely to be heavily AI driven, and we intend to invite papers covering the following aspects, (a) Capturing human capabilities through intelligent models and how to adapt them through changing perceptions, needs, and skills. (2) High level tools that provide the ability for all stakeholders in the new ecosystem, including regulators for policies and AI workers, to specify their requirements. (3) system design and engineering of job platforms for collection, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data deluge about workers, jobs, and their activities. (4) Benchmarking and the development of appropriate metrics to measure system performance as well as human aspects, such as satisfaction, capital advancement, and equity. 
<br/><br/>

We welcome any interesting ideas and results on any relevant topics, but this year, we encourage submitting papers on <b>new projects inspired by the COVID-19 crisis</b>, such as those on human-in-the-loop solutions in the pandemic, those on re-evaluating how we organize labor and how we share work with machines in the future.


To make the workshop an attractive place for those people, we solicit <b>practitioner papers</b> as well as <b>research papers</b>, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners who know problems. 
We also would like to make the place valuable for young researchers. 
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.

<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of topics of human-machine collaboration in work with bigdata. Keywords include: crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction, human-machine collaboration in real-world problems, and ELSI in Human-in-the-loop systems and Future of Work. 
We expect submissions to address some of the following issues:
<ol>
<li>capturing human characteristics and capabilities, stakeholder requirement specification,
<li>social processes around the human-in-the-loop systems, 
<li>platforms and ecosystems,
<li>computation capabilities, and
<li>benchmarks and metrics for human-in-the-loop systems and Future of Work
 </ol>

<b>Bio:</b> 
Daniel S. Weld is Thomas J. Cable / WRF Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and Entrepreneurial Faculty Fellow at the University of Washington. After formative education at Phillips Academy, he received bachelor's degrees in both Computer Science and Biochemistry at Yale University in 1982. He landed a Ph.D. from the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1988, received a Presidential Young Investigator's award in 1989, an Office of Naval Research Young Investigator's award in 1990, was named AAAI Fellow in 1999 and deemed ACM Fellow in 2005. Dan was a founding editor for the Journal of AI Research, was area editor for the Journal of the ACM, guest editor for Computational Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence, and was Program Chair for AAAI-96. Dan has published two books and scads of technical papers.
Dan is an active entrepreneur with several patents and technology licenses. He co-founded Netbot Incorporated, creator of Jango Shopping Search (acquired by Excite), AdRelevance, a monitoring service for internet advertising (acquired by Nielsen NetRatings), and data integration company Nimble Technology (acquired by Actuate). Dan is a Venture Partner at the Madrona Venture Group and on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence and the Madrona Venture Group.

Dan teaches many courses, including graduate classes on Artificial Intelligence, Extracting, Managing & Personalizing Web Information and Intelligent User Interfaces, and undergraduate classes on Artficial Intelligence, Advanced Internet Systems, and Machine Learning. In 2012, Dan co-organized a workshop on Crowdsourcing Personalized Online Education. During sabbaticals Dan was a visiting professor at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia and visited the VIBE group at Microsoft Research.

<h2 id="submission" style="text-align:center">Submission</h2>

All submissions must be submitted electorically through the submission page (to appear soon).</a>
<u>Please <b>prefix your submission category</b> such as [Research Paper] to the Title of Paper field in the submission page.</u> 
For example, if you would like to submit a project-in-progress paper "Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance," you have to put  "[project-in-progress paper] Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance" into the Title of Paper field.<br/>
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.


<h3>Submission Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research Papers (*) (long presentation): They report significant and original
results relevant to the scope of this workshop. We solicit innovative or
thought-provoking work but they do not necessarily have to reach the
level of completion. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages. The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>Practitioner papers (*)(long presentation): They present interesting
problems that
require human-in-the-loop solutions in a variety of application domains, or
present the interesting results of applying existing human-in-the-loop
solutions to
their domains. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages.  The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>
Project-in-progress papers (short presentation): They present the goals,
challenges, and preliminary results of research or real-world projects
in progress.
The maximum length is 3 pages.
</ul>

(*) Some of the papers submitted to the research or practitioner paper
categories may be accepted as project-in-progress papers and allotted to short
presentation slots.

<h3>Format</h3>
Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines in the <a href="http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2020/CallPapers.html">IEEE Bigdata 2020 CFP page</a>
