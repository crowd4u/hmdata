<h2 id="about" style="text-align:center">About IEEE HMData 2019</h2>
<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>
Human power is a key factor to maximize the impact of bigdata technologies. This workshop addresses human-in-the-loop approaches in bigdata lifecycle - in collecting, processing, analyzing, utilizing, archiving and disposing them. The purpose of this workshop is to give excellent opportunities for students, researchers and practitioners to identify important research problems and exchange their ideas on human-in-the-loop in the bigdata context.  To make the workshop an attractive place for those people, we solicit <b>practitioner papers</b> as well as <b>research papers</b>, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners who know problems. 
We also would like to make the place valuable for young researchers. 
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.
</div>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of human-related topics in the bigdata context, such as crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction,  supporting  tools for humans in  human-in-the-loop systems, security and privacy in human-machine collaboration , human factors and ELSI (ethical, legal and social issues) in human-in-the-loop systems, and  human-machine collaboration in real-world problems.

<b>Bio:</b> 
Michael Bernstein is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, 
where he is a member of the Human-Computer Interaction group. 
His research focuses on the design of social computing and crowdsourcing systems. 
Michael's research has received awards at premier computing venues, 
and he has been recognized with an NSF CAREER award and an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship. 
His Ph.D. students have gone on both to industry (e.g., Adobe Research, Facebook Data Science, entrepreneurship) 
and faculty careers (e.g., Carnegie Mellon, UC Berkeley). 
Michael holds a bachelor's degree in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University, 
as well as a master's degree and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT.

<ul>
<li>Oct 7 (Mon), 2019: Due date for workshop papers submission
<li>Nov 1 (Fri), 2019: Notification of paper acceptance to authors
<li>Nov 15 (Fri), 2019: Camera-ready of accepted papers
<li>Dec 9-12 (Mon-Thu), 2019: Workshops
</ul>


<h2 id="submission" style="text-align:center">Submission</h2>

All submissions must be submitted electorically through the submission page (to appear soon).</a>
<u>Please <b>prefix your submission category</b> such as [Research Paper] to the Title of Paper field in the submission page.</u> 
For example, if you would like to submit a project-in-progress paper "Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance," you have to put  "[project-in-progress paper] Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance" into the Title of Paper field.<br/>
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.


<h3>Submission Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research Papers (*) (long presentation): They report significant and original
results relevant to the scope of this workshop. We solicit innovative or
thought-provoking work but they do not necessarily have to reach the
level of completion. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages. The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>Practitioner papers (*)(long presentation): They present interesting
problems that
require human-in-the-loop solutions in a variety of application domains, or
present the interesting results of applying existing human-in-the-loop
solutions to
their domains. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages.  The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>
Project-in-progress papers (short presentation): They present the goals,
challenges, and preliminary results of research or real-world projects
in progress.
The maximum length is 3 pages.
</ul>

(*) Some of the papers submitted to the research or practitioner paper
categories may be accepted as project-in-progress papers and allotted to short
presentation slots.

<h3>Format</h3>
Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines in the <a href="https://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2019/CallPapers.html">IEEE Bigdata 2019 CFP page</a>

<h2 id="sts" style="text-align:center">Student Travel Support</h2>
