<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>
Human power is a key factor to maximize the impact of bigdata technologies. This workshop addresses human-in-the-loop approaches in bigdata lifecycle - in collecting, processing, analyzing, utilizing, archiving and disposing them. The purpose of this workshop is to give excellent opportunities for students, researchers and practitioners to identify important research problems and exchange their ideas on human-in-the-loop in the bigdata context.  To make the workshop an attractive place for those people, we solicit <b>practitioner papers</b> as well as <b>research papers</b>, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners who know problems. 
We also would like to make the place valuable for young researchers. 
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.
</div>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of human-related topics in the bigdata context, such as crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction,  supporting  tools for humans in  human-in-the-loop systems, security and privacy in human-machine collaboration , human factors and ELSI (ethical, legal and social issues) in human-in-the-loop systems, and  human-machine collaboration in real-world problems.

<b>Abstract: </b>Can computation amplify our ability to achieve complex collective goals? 
 Today's techniques in areas such as crowdsourcing often fall short of this vision, in large 
 part because their architecture is based on workflows, which are so inflexible that 
 they can only be used for simple and modular goals. In this talk, I offer an alternative 
 architecture based on computational organizational structures, and demonstrate that this 
 approach enables groups to flexibly collaborate toward complex and open-ended goals such 
 as product design, software engineering, and top-tier research. I will introduce techniques 
 that fluidly assemble flash organizations and continuously adapt their efforts, evolve team 
 structures and membership over time, and coordinate volunteers around the world in pursuing 
 open-ended research. This research argues for a shift away from crowdsourcing as simple 
 microtasks, wiki edits, or competitions, and toward computational systems that proactively 
 aid groups in working together nimbly, reactively, and effectively toward complex goals.

<b>Bio:</b> 
Michael Bernstein is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University, where 
 he is a member of the Human-Computer Interaction group. His research focuses on the design 
 of social computing and crowdsourcing systems. Michael's research has received awards at 
 premier computing venues, and he has been recognized with an NSF CAREER award and an 
 Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship. His Ph.D. students have gone on both to industry (e.g., 
 Adobe Research, Facebook Data Science) and faculty careers (e.g., Carnegie Mellon, 
 UC Berkeley). Michael holds a bachelor's degree in Symbolic Systems from Stanford University, 
 as well as a master's degree and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from MIT.
