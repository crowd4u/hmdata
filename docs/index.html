<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>

HMData workshop, which originally started as the "Human-Machine collaboration in BigData" workshop, will investigate the opportunities and challenges in human machine collaboration in work with bigdata, which are described by two terms: Human-in- the-Loop Methods and Future of Work. Human-in-the-Loop is a term focusing on the employer's viewpoint while Future of Work focuses more on worker's viewpoint, in both of which the division of labor among humans and machines is a key issue. 
This area is likely to be heavily AI driven, and we intend to invite papers covering the following aspects, (a) Capturing human capabilities through intelligent models and how to adapt them through changing perceptions, needs, and skills. (2) High level tools that provide the ability for all stakeholders in the new ecosystem, including regulators for policies and AI workers, to specify their requirements. (3) system design and engineering of job platforms for collection, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data deluge about workers, jobs, and their activities. (4) Benchmarking and the development of appropriate metrics to measure system performance as well as human aspects, such as satisfaction, capital advancement, and equity.
<br/><br/>

We welcome any interesting ideas and results on any relevant topics, but <b>this workshop encourages submitting papers the results of which have been or will be implemented as platforms, tools and libraries</b>.  This year, we plan to have a thematic session on improving the interoperability of tools on Human-in-the-loop Methods and Future-of-Work.

We also solicit <b>practitioner papers</b> as well as <b>research papers</b>, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers have solutions and practitioners who know problems.
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.
</div>



<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of topics of human-machine collaboration in work with bigdata. Keywords include: crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction, human-machine collaboration in real-world applications (such as natural disaster response, education, and citizen science), and ELSI in Human-in-the-loop systems and Future of Work. 

We expect submissions to address some of the following issues: 
<ol>
<li>capturing human characteristics and capabilities,
<li>stakeholder requirement specification,
<li> social processes around the human-in-the-loop systems,
<li>platforms and ecosystems,
<li>computation capabilities, and
<li>benchmarks and metrics for human-in-the-loop systems and Future of Work
</ol>

<!--<b>Data Excellence: Better Data for Better AI</b><br/>-->

<!-- <div>
<b>Abstract: </b>The efficacy of machine learning (ML) models depends on both algorithms and data. 
  Training data defines what we want our models to learn, and testing data provides the means by 
  which their empirical progress is measured. Benchmark datasets define the entire world within which 
  models exist and operate, yet research continues to focus on critiquing and improving the algorithmic 
  aspect of the models rather than critiquing and improving the data with which our models operate. 
  If "data is the new oil," we are still missing work on the refineries by which the data itself could 
  be optimized for more effective use. In this talk, I will discuss data excellence and lessons 
  learned from software engineering to achieve the scare and rigor in assessing data quality.

<b>Bio:</b> 
Ming Yin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University. Her research broadly connects to the fields of human-computer interaction, applied artificial intelligence and machine learning, computational social science, and behavioral sciences. She uses both experimental and computational approaches to examine how to better utilize the wisdom of crowd to enhance machine intelligence (i.e., crowdsourcing and social computing), and how to better design intelligent systems that people can understand, trust and engage with effectively (i.e., human-AI interaction).
Prior to Purdue, She spent a year at Microsoft Research New York City as a postdoctoral researcher in the Computational Social Science group. She completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science at Harvard University, and received her bachelor degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

<h3>Submission Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Research Papers (*) (long presentation): They report significant and original
results relevant to the scope of this workshop. We solicit innovative or
thought-provoking work but they do not necessarily have to reach the
level of completion. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages. The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>Practitioner papers (*)(long presentation): They present interesting
problems that
require human-in-the-loop solutions in a variety of application domains, or
present the interesting results of applying existing human-in-the-loop
solutions to
their domains. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages.  The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>
Project-in-progress papers (short presentation): They present the goals,
challenges, and preliminary results of research or real-world projects
in progress.
The maximum length is 3 pages.
</ul>

(*) Some of the papers submitted to the research or practitioner paper
categories may be accepted as project-in-progress papers and allotted to short
presentation slots.

<h3>Format</h3>
Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines in the <a href="http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2022/CallPapers.html">IEEE Bigdata 2022 CFP page</a>
