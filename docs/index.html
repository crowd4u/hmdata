<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>
HMData workshop, which originally started as the "Human-Machine collaboration in BigData" workshop, will investigate the opportunities and challenges in <b>human machine collaboration</b> in work with bigdata, which are described by two terms: <b>Human-in-the-Loop Methods</b> and <b>Future of Work</b>.
Human-in-the-Loop is a term focusing on the employer's viewpoint while Future of Work focuses more on worker's viewpoint, in both of which the division of labor among humans and machines is a key issue.
This area is likely to be heavily AI driven, and we intend to invite papers covering the following aspects, (a) Capturing human capabilities through intelligent models and how to adapt them through changing perceptions, needs, and skills. (2) High level tools that provide the ability for all stakeholders in the new ecosystem, including regulators for policies and AI workers, to specify their requirements. (3) system design and engineering of job platforms for collection, storage, retrieval, and analysis of data deluge about workers, jobs, and their activities. (4) Benchmarking and the development of appropriate metrics to measure system performance as well as human aspects, such as satisfaction, capital advancement, and equity. 
<br/><br/>

We welcome any interesting ideas and results on any relevant topics, but we also encourage submitting papers on <b>new projects inspired by the COVID-19 crisis</b>, such as those on human-in-the-loop solutions in the pandemic, those on re-evaluating how we organize labor and how we share work with machines in the future.


To make the workshop an attractive place for those people, we solicit <b>practitioner papers</b> as well as <b>research papers</b>, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners who know problems. 
We also would like to make the place valuable for young researchers. 
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.

<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of topics of human-machine collaboration in work with bigdata. Keywords include: crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction, human-machine collaboration in real-world applications (such as natural disaster response, education, and citizen science), and ELSI in Human-in-the-loop systems and Future of Work. 
We expect submissions to address some of the following issues:
<ol>
<li>capturing human characteristics and capabilities,
<li>stakeholder requirement specification,
<li>social processes around the human-in-the-loop systems,
<li>platforms and ecosystems,
<li>computation capabilities, and
<li>benchmarks and metrics for human-in-the-loop systems and Future of Work
 </ol>

<b>Abstract: </b>Professional investigators in fields such as journalism, 
  law enforcement, and academia have long sought the public's help in solving mysteries, 
  typically by providing tips. However, as social technologies capture more digital traces of daily life 
  and enable new forms of collaboration, members of the public are increasingly leading their own investigations. 
  These efforts are perhaps best known for high-profile failures characterized by sloppy research and vigilantism, 
  such as the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing manhunt on Reddit and 4chan. However, other crowdsourced investigations 
  have led to the successful recovery of missing persons and apprehension of violent criminals, suggesting real potential. 
  In this talk, I present three projects from my research group, the Crowd Intelligence Lab, where we build software tools 
  that bring together crowds, experts, and AI to support ethical and effective investigations and solve mysteries. 
  In the CrowdIA project, we adapted the sensemaking loop for intelligence analysts to enable novice crowds to discover
  a hidden terrorist plot within large quantities of textual evidence documents. In the GroundTruth project, 
  we developed a novel diagramming technique to enable novice crowds to collaborate with expert investigators to 
  geolocate and verify (or debunk) photos and videos shared on social media. In the Photo Sleuth project, 
  we built and launched a free public website with over 10,000 registered users who employ AI-based face recognition 
  to identify unknown soldiers in historical portraits from the American Civil War era. I will conclude the talk 
  by discussing broader opportunities and risks in combining the complementary strengths of human and artificial 
  intelligence for investigation, sensemaking, and other complex and creative tasks.

<b>Bio:</b> 
Lora Aroyo is a Full Professor in Computer Science, currently working as a visiting research faculty at Google, NYC. Previously she was a visiting scholar at the Columbia Data Science Institute at Columbia University, New York. She is also Chief of Science for a NY-based startup Tagasauris, which works on hybrid machine learning and human-assisted computing strategies to enrich multimedia (e.g. video, images, and text) with meaningful information about its content, and ultimately improve video search and discovery.

Lora is an active member of the Human Computation, User Modeling & Semantic Web communities. She is president of the User Modeling community UM Inc, which serves as a steering committee for the ACM Conference Series “User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization” (UMAP) sponsored by SIGCHI and SIGWEB. She is also a member of the ACM SIGCHI conferences board. Since 2010 she has actively worked towards shaping the concept of “User-Centric Data Science“, which ultimately led to the forming of and heading the User-centric Data Science group at the Department of Computer Science, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
 
As an expert in user-centric data science, Lora conceived the vision of an user-centric experimental lab for computer science researchers at the VU University Amsterdam. She headed the team that made it possible in 2010 to open VU INTERTAIN Lab – the first of its kind in an academic environment. Throughout her carrier, Lora was a principal investigator of a large number of research projects, she organized conferences, workshops, and tutorials to bring together methods and tools from human computation, linked (open) data, data science & human-computer interaction with the goal of building hybrid human-AI systems for augmenting both machine and human intelligence for understanding text, images, and videos with humans-in-the-loop and machines-in-the-loop. Her research projects focussing on semantic search, recommendation systems, personalized access to online multimedia collections have a major impact and established her as a recognized leader in human computation techniques for specific domains, such as digital humanities, cultural heritage, and interactive TV.
