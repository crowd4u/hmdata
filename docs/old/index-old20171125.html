<h2 id="about" style="text-align:center"> About HMData 2017</h2>
<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>
Human power is a key factor to maximize the impact of bigdata technologies. This workshop addresses human-in-the-loop approaches in bigdata lifecycle - in collecting, processing, analyzing, utilizing, archiving and disposing them. The purpose of this workshop is to give excellent opportunities for students, researchers and practitioners to identify important research problems and exchange their ideas on human-in-the-loop in the bigdata context.  To make the workshop an attractive place for those people, we plan to solicit practitioner papers as well as research papers, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners who know problems. 
We also would like to make the place valuable for young researchers. We plan to provide student travel support. 
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.
</div>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of human-related topics in the bigdata context, such as crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction, and human-machine collaboration in real-world problems.

<h2 id="submission" style="text-align:center">Submission</h2>

All submissions must be submitted electorically through <a href="https://wi-lab.com/cyberchair/2017/bigdata17/scripts/submit.php?subarea=S35&undisplay_detail=1&wh=/cyberchair/2017/bigdata17/scripts/ws_submit.php">CyberChair</a>.
<u>Please <b>prefix your submission category</b> such as [Research Paper] to the Title of Paper field in the submission page.</u> 
For example, if you would like to submit a project-in-progress paper "Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance," you have to put  "[project-in-progress paper] Crowd-centric Approach to Digital Archive Maintenance" into the Title of Paper field.<br/>
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.


<h3>Submission Categories </h3>
<ul>
<li>Research Papers (*) (long presentation): They report significant and original
results relevant to the scope of this workshop. We solicit innovative or
thought-provoking work but they do not necessarily have to reach the
level of completion. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages. The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>Practitioner papers (*)(long presentation): They present interesting
problems that
require human-in-the-loop solutions in a variety of application domains, or
present the interesting results of applying existing human-in-the-loop
solutions to
their domains. The expected length is between 4 and 6 pages.  The maximum length is 10 pages, though the paper should be commensurate with the size of the contribution.
<li>
Project-in-progress papers (short presentation): They present the goals,
challenges, and preliminary results of research or real-world projects
in progress.
The maximum length is 3 pages.
</ul>

(*) Some of the papers submitted to the research or practitioner paper
categories may be accepted as project-in-progress papers and allotted to short
presentation slots.

<h3>Format</h3>
Papers should be formatted to IEEE Computer Society Proceedings Manuscript Formatting Guidelines in the <a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2017/CallPapers.html">IEEE Bigdata 2017 CFP page</a>

<h2 id="sts" style="text-align:center">Student Travel Support</h2>
