<h3> Overview</h3>
<div>
Human power is a key factor to maximize the impact of bigdata technologies. This workshop addresses human-in-the-loop approaches in bigdata lifecycle - in collecting, processing, analyzing, utilizing, archiving and disposing them. The purpose of this workshop is to give excellent opportunities for students, researchers and practitioners to identify important research problems and exchange their ideas on human-in-the-loop in the bigdata context.  To make the workshop an attractive place for those people, we plan to solicit practitioner papers as well as research papers, in order to facilitate discussion among researchers who know solutions and practitioners who know problems. 
We also would like to make the place valuable for young researchers. We plan to provide student travel support. 
All papers accepted for the workshop will be included in the Workshop Proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, made available at the Conference.
</div>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<div>
This workshop covers a wide range of human-related topics in the bigdata context, such as crowdsourcing, collaborative recommendation, crowdsensing, workflow model for humans and machines, incentives, human-assisted bigdata analysis, bigdata-human interaction, and human-machine collaboration in real-world problems.

<b>Abstract: </b>We describe Quizz, a gamified crowdsourcing system that simultaneously
assesses the knowledge of users and acquires new knowledge from them.
Quizz operates by asking users to complete short quizzes on specific
topics; as a user answers the quiz questions, Quizz estimates the
user�s competence. To acquire new knowledge, Quizz also incorporates
questions for which we do not have a known answer; the answers given
by competent users provide useful signals for selecting the correct
answers for these questions. Quizz actively tries to identify
knowledgeable users on the Internet by running advertising campaigns,
effectively leveraging �for free� the targeting capabilities of
existing, publicly available, ad placement services. Quizz quantifies
the contributions of the users using information theory and sends
feedback to the advertising system about each user. The feedback
allows the ad targeting mechanism to further optimize ad placement.
Our experiments, which involve over ten thousand users, confirm that
we can crowdsource knowledge curation for niche and specialized
topics, as the advertising network can automatically identify users
with the desired expertise and interest in the given topic. We present
controlled experiments that examine the effect of various incentive
mechanisms, highlighting the need for having short-term rewards as
goals, which incentivize the users to contribute. Finally, our
cost-quality analysis indicates that the cost of our approach is below
that of hiring workers through paid-crowdsourcing platforms, while
offering the additional advantage of giving access to billions of
potential users all over the planet, and being able to reach users
with specialized expertise that is not typically available through
existing labor marketplaces.
